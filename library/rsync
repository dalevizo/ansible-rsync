module: synchronize
short_description: Synchronize one path with another C(rsync) made simple
description:
     - This module was designed to make synchronizing file structuures from one place to another using
	   C(rsync) in your Ansible playbooks quick and easy. Of course you could just use the command action
	   to call rsync yourself, but you also have to add a fair number of boilerplate options and host 
	   facts. You still may need to. The synchronize action is meant to do common things with C(rsync) easily. It does not provide access to the full power of rsync.
options:
  src:
    description:
      - Path on the source machine that will be synchronized to the destination; The path can be
	    absolute or relative.
    required: true
    default: null
  dest:
    description:
      - Path on the destination machine that will be synchronized from the source; The path can be
	    absolute or relative.
    required: true
    default: null
  mode:
    description:
      - Specify the direction of the synchroniztion. In push mode the localhost or delgate is the 
	    source; In pull mode the inventory hostname in context is the source.	  
    required: false
	choices: [ 'push', 'pull' ]
	default: 'push'
  verbosity:
    description:
      - An integrater controling the amount of information returned during processing. The greater
	    the value the more information rsync will report back. See the C(-v, --verbose) option of
		the rsync man page for details. If verbosity is not defined or a value of 0 is assumed, the
		C(--quiet) option is passed and information is supressed.
    required: false
    default: 0
  delete:
    description:
      - Delete files that don't exist (after transfer, not before) in C(src) path.
    choices: [ 'yes', 'no' ]
    default: 'no'
    required: false
examples:
   - code: 'synchronize: src=some/relative/path dest=/some/absolute/path'
     description: 'Synchronize the src on the localhost or delegate to the dest on the host in context.'
   - code: 'synchronize: src=some/relative/path dest=/some/absolute/path mode=pull'
     description: 'Synchronize the src on the host in context to the dest on the localhost or delegate.'
   - code: 'synchronize: src=some/relative/path dest=/some/absolute/path delete=yes'
     description: 'Synchronize and delete files in dest not found in src.'
   - code: 'synchronize: src=some/relative/path dest=/some/absolute/path verbosity=1'
     description: 'Synchronize and return verbose information from the rsync transfer.'
